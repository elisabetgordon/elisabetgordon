# About Me
I am a geography major who specialized in GIS. I am now getting into the programming scene in order to advance my career. I do have a lot of experience using wikimarkup and I can more or less navigate html and CSS comfortably.
At the moment, I am currently learning python and working on job portfolio stuff.

My interests consist of video games, seals, and music. I know a bit of Japanese and I am also learning spanish.
